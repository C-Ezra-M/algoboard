# Algoboard

## Motivation

- The original Processing script was written for the original Processing, which retains some elements from Java. It has a web port, but it is no longer maintained and has been superseded by p5.js.
- p5.js changes things that necessitate the conversion of functions and the removal of Java's type annotations.
- The original Processing script is, in my opinion, poorly structured. Changing the number of people to be eliminated is in a different place than the rest of the data.
- The features are limited by the limitations of Processing.
